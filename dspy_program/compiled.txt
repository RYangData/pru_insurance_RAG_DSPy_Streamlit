        "question": "What are the differences in the Intensive Care Benefit when the insured is outside Hong Kong for PRUHealth Critical Illness Extended Care III and PRUHealth Critical Illness First Protect II?",
        "answer": "Both plans reduce the ICU benefit for hospital stays outside Hong Kong. However, Extended Care III adjusts the cover to up to 10% of the current sum assured, while First Protect II also adjusts to 10% but caps the benefit with a specific limit under all policies for the same life assured, reflecting a structured limitation not detailed in Extended Care III."
