      "\n",
      "We aim to protect the rights and manage the reasonable expectations of all Shareholder-backed Participating policyholders. Our investment objective is to maximise policyholders’ returns with an acceptable level of risk. We do this through a broad mix of investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Shareholder-backed Participating Fund invests in various types of assets, such as equity-type securities and fixed-income securities to diversify investment risks. The equity-type securities aim to provide policyholders with the potential for a higher long-term return.\n",
      "\n",
      "We adopt an actively managed investment strategy, which we adjust in response to changing market conditions. Under normal circumstances, our experts allocate a smaller proportion of higher-risk assets, such as equities, to insurance plans with a higher guarantee and a larger proportion of higher-risk assets to insurance plans with lower guarantees. In doing so, we aim to match the level of risk to the risk profiles of our products. We may utilise derivatives to manage risks or improve returns. We may also make use of securities-lending to enhance returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following paragraphs explain the current investment mix according to our investment strategy. Should there be any material changes in the investment strategy, we will inform you of the changes and explain the reasons behind and their implications.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The investment mix of your plan\n",
      "\n",
      "The current long-term target asset allocation is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "|Asset type|Allocation (%)|\n",
      "|---|---|\n",
      "|Fixed-income securities|55%|\n",
      "|Equity-type securities|45%|\n",
      "\n",
      "Our guaranteed liabilities to the policyholders are mainly supported by fixed-income securities. We primarily invest in fixed-income securities rated at least investment-grade. A small portion of high-yield and emerging-market bonds may be included to improve yield and diversification. For equity-type securities, most of the investments are in stocks listed on major international exchanges.\n",
      "---\n",
      "Our currency strategy is to broadly match the fixed-income securities to the underlying policy denomination, while we allow more flexibility for equity-type securities for diversification. Subject to market availability and opportunity, we may invest fixed-income securities in a currency other than the underlying policy denomination and currency hedging may be used to reduce the currency risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "We invest globally to achieve diversification benefits and we currently have a higher relative allocation in the US and Asia which will be reviewed regularly.\n",
      "\n",
      "We actively manage and adjust actual exposure in response to changing market conditions and opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given asset values may vary due to changes in the economic environment and investment performance, the actual allocation may vary from the target allocation above. On a regular basis, we review the investment mix to be in line with our investment objectives and risk appetite.

      "\n",
      "How may our credit risk affect your policy?\n",
      "\n",
      "The guaranteed cash value (if applicable) and insurance benefit of your plan are subject to our credit risk. If we become insolvent, you may lose the value of your policy and its coverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "How may currency exchange rate risk affect your benefits?\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign currency exchange rates may fluctuate. As a result, you may incur a substantial loss when you choose to convert your benefits to other currencies. Additionally, the conversion of your benefits to other currencies is subject to exchange restrictions applicable at the time when the benefits are paid. You have the sole responsibility to decide if you want to convert your benefits to other currencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the risks of surrendering your plan or withdrawing money from your plan?\n",
      "\n",
      "The liquidity of an insurance policy is limited. You are strongly advised to reserve adequate liquid assets for emergencies. For any surrender/withdrawal especially at the early stage upon policy inception, you may receive an amount considerably less than the premiums you paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "How may inflation affect the value of your plan?\n",
      "\n",
      "We expect the cost of living to rise in the future because of inflation. That means the insurance you take out today will not have the same buying power in the future, even if the plan offers increasing benefit intended to offset inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "What happens if you do not pay your premiums?\n",
      "\n",
      "You should only apply for this product if you intend to pay all of its premiums. If you miss any of your premium payments, we will automatically settle your outstanding premiums or premiums and levy(ies) by an automatic premium loan, with interest charged at a rate as determined by us. In the case the loan amount (plus accrued interest) exceeds the amount we allow for loan under the policy, we may terminate your policy and you may receive an amount considerably less than the premiums you paid, as well as losing the policy’s coverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why may we adjust your premiums?\n",
      "\n",
      "We have the right to review and adjust the plan’s premium rates for particular risk classes on each policy anniversary, but not for any individual customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may adjust premium rates because of several factors, such as our claims, investment and persistency experience.\n",
      "---\n",
      "## Important information\n",
      "\n",
      "Suicide clause\n",
      "\n",
      "If the life assured commits suicide regardless of sane or insane within 1 year from the effective date of the policy or from the date of any reinstatement, whichever is later, the death benefit will be limited to a refund of the premiums paid without interest subject to the deduction of any amounts we have already paid and any indebtedness you owe us under the policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cancellation right\n",
      "\n",
      "A customer who has bought the life insurance plans has a right to cancel the policy within the cooling-off period and obtain a refund of any premium(s) and levy(ies) paid less any withdrawals. Provided that no claim has been made, the customer may cancel the policy by giving written notice to us within 21 calendar days immediately following either the day of delivery of (1) the policy or (2) the notice (informing the availability of the policy and expiry date of the cooling-off period) to the customer or his/her nominated representative, whichever is earlier. Such notice must be signed by the customer and received directly by Prudential Hong Kong Limited at 8/F, Prudential Tower, The Gateway, Harbour City, 21 Canton Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong within the cooling-off period.\n",
      "\n",
      "The premium and levy will be refunded in the currency of premium and levy payment at the time of application for this policy. If the currency of premium and levy payment is not the same as the plan currency, the refundable premium and levy amount in plan currency under this policy will be converted to the currency of premium and levy payment at the prevailing currency exchange rate as determined by us in our absolute discretion from time to time upon payment. After the cooling-off period expires, if a customer cancels the policy before the end of benefit term, the actual cash value (if applicable) may be substantially less than the total amount of premiums paid.\n",

      "Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information\n",
      "\n",
      "Over 100 countries and jurisdictions around the world have committed to adopt new rules for automatic exchange of financial account information (“AEOI”). Under the new rules, financial institutions are required to identify account holders who are foreign tax residents and report certain information regarding their investment income and account balance to the local tax authority where the financial institution operates. When countries or jurisdictions start exchanging information on an automatic basis, the relevant local tax authority where the financial account is maintained will then provide this information to the tax authority of the account holder’s country of tax residence. This information exchange will be conducted on a regular, annual basis.\n",

Therefore, the above requirements will be applicable to financial institutions in Hong Kong including Prudential. Under these rules, certain policyholders of Prudential are considered as “account holders”. Financial institutions in Hong Kong including Prudential are required to implement due diligence procedures to identify account holders (i.e. policyholders in case where the financial institution is an insurance company) and in the case where the account holder is an entity, its “controlling persons”, who are foreign tax residents, and report this information to the Inland Revenue Department (“IRD”) if required. The IRD may transfer this information to the country of tax residence of such account holders.\n",

      "2. provide us all required information and documentation for complying with Prudential’s due diligence procedures; and\n",
      "3. advise us of any change in circumstances which affect your tax residence status and provide us with a suitably updated self-certification form within 30 days of such change in circumstances.\n",

      "\n",
      "Prudential cannot provide you with any tax or legal advice. If you have doubts about your tax residence you should seek professional advice. You should seek independent professional advice on the impact that AEOI may have on you or your policy.\n",

      "#Investment Philosophy and Strategy\n",
      "\n",
      "##Investment Objective\n",
      "Our aim is to protect the rights and manage the reasonable expectations of all Shareholder-backed Participating policyholders. The investment objective is to maximize policyholders’ returns while maintaining an acceptable level of risk. This is achieved through a diverse mix of investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Investment Strategy\n",
      "The Shareholder-backed Participating Fund invests in various asset types, including equity-type securities and fixed-income securities, to diversify investment risks. Equity-type securities are chosen to provide policyholders with the potential for higher long-term returns. We employ an actively managed investment strategy that is adjusted in response to changing market conditions. Our experts allocate a smaller proportion of higher-risk assets, such as equities, to insurance plans with higher guarantees and a larger proportion to plans with lower guarantees. This approach aims to align the level of risk with the risk profiles of our products. Derivatives may be utilized to manage risks or enhance returns, and securities-lending may be employed to boost returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "###Current Investment Mix\n",
      "The current long-term target asset allocation is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "| Asset Type            | Allocation (%) |\n",
      "|-----------------------|----------------|\n",
      "| Fixed-income securities | 55%          |\n",
      "| Equity-type securities  | 45%          |\n",
      "\n",
      "Our guaranteed liabilities to policyholders are primarily supported by fixed-income securities. We predominantly invest in fixed-income securities rated at least investment-grade, with a small portion allocated to high-yield and emerging-market bonds for improved yield and diversification. When it comes to equity-type securities, the majority of investments are in stocks listed on major international exchanges.\n",
      "---\n",
      "#Currency Strategy\n",
      "\n",
      "##Investment Approach\n",
      "Our currency strategy is to broadly match the fixed-income securities to the underlying policy denomination, while we allow more flexibility for equity-type securities for diversification. Subject to market availability and opportunity, we may invest fixed-income securities in a currency other than the underlying policy denomination and currency hedging may be used to reduce the currency risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Global Diversification\n",
      "We invest globally to achieve diversification benefits and we currently have a higher relative allocation in the US and Asia which will be reviewed regularly.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Active Management\n",
      "We actively manage and adjust actual exposure in response to changing market conditions and opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Asset Allocation\n",
      "Given asset values may vary due to changes in the economic environment and investment performance, the actual allocation may vary from the target allocation above. On a regular basis, we review the investment mix to be in line with our investment objectives and risk appetite. For more information on the investment mix, please refer to [Investment Mix](https://pruhk.co/investmentmix-en).\n",

      "#Key risks\n",
      "\n",
      "##How may our credit risk affect your policy?\n",
      "Foreign currency exchange rates may fluctuate. As a result, you may incur a substantial loss when you choose to convert your benefits to other currencies. Additionally, the conversion of your benefits to other currencies is subject to exchange restrictions applicable at the time when the benefits are paid. You have the sole responsibility to decide if you want to convert your benefits to other currencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "##How may currency exchange rate risk affect your benefits?\n",
      "The guaranteed cash value (if applicable) and insurance benefit of your plan are subject to our credit risk. If we become insolvent, you may lose the value of your policy and its coverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "##What are the risks of surrendering your plan or withdrawing money from your plan?\n",
      "The liquidity of an insurance policy is limited. You are strongly advised to reserve adequate liquid assets for emergencies. For any surrender/withdrawal especially at the early stage upon policy inception, you may receive an amount considerably less than the premiums you paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "##How may inflation affect the value of your plan?\n",
      "We expect the cost of living to rise in the future because of inflation. That means the insurance you take out today will not have the same buying power in the future, even if the plan offers increasing benefit intended to offset inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "##What happens if you do not pay your premiums?\n",
      "You should only apply for this product if you intend to pay all of its premiums. If you miss any of your premium payments, we will automatically settle your outstanding premiums or premiums and levy(ies) by an automatic premium loan, with interest charged at a rate as determined by us. In the case the loan amount (plus accrued interest) exceeds the amount we allow for loan under the policy, we may terminate your policy and you may receive an amount considerably less than the premiums you paid, as well as losing the policy’s coverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Why may we adjust your premiums?\n",
      "We have the right to review and adjust the plan’s premium rates for particular risk classes on each policy anniversary, but not for any individual customer. We may adjust premium rates because of several factors, such as our claims, investment, and persistency experience.\n",
      "---\n",
      "#Important information\n",
      "\n",
      "##Suicide clause\n",
      "###Cancellation right\n",
      "- A customer who has bought the life insurance plans has a right to cancel the policy within the cooling-off period and obtain a refund of any premium(s) and levy(ies) paid less any withdrawals. Provided that no claim has been made, the customer may cancel the policy by giving written notice to us within 21 calendar days immediately following either the day of delivery of (1) the policy or (2) the notice (informing the availability of the policy and expiry date of the cooling-off period) to the customer or his/her nominated representative, whichever is earlier. Such notice must be signed by the customer and received directly by Prudential Hong Kong Limited at 8/F, Prudential Tower, The Gateway, Harbour City, 21 Canton Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong within the cooling-off period. The premium and levy will be refunded in the currency of premium and levy payment at the time of application for this policy. If the currency of premium and levy payment is not the same as the plan currency, the refundable premium and levy amount in plan currency under this policy will be converted to the currency of premium and levy payment at the prevailing currency exchange rate as determined by us in our absolute discretion from time to time upon payment. After the cooling-off period expires, if a customer cancels the policy before the end of benefit term, the actual cash value (if applicable) may be substantially less than the total amount of premiums paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information\n",
      "- Over 100 countries and jurisdictions around the world have committed to adopt new rules for automatic exchange of financial account information (“AEOI”). Under the new rules, financial institutions are required to identify account holders who are foreign tax residents and report certain information regarding their investment income and account balance to the local tax authority where the financial institution operates. When countries or jurisdictions start exchanging information on an automatic basis, the relevant local tax authority where the financial account is maintained will then provide this information to the tax authority of the account holder’s country of tax residence. This information exchange will be conducted on a regular, annual basis. Hong Kong has adopted the new rules into its legislation (please see the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 3) Ordinance 2016 (“the Amendment Ordinance”) which came into effect on 30 June 2016). Therefore, the above requirements will be applicable to financial institutions in Hong Kong including Prudential. Under these rules, certain policyholders of Prudential are considered as “account holders”. Financial institutions in Hong Kong including Prudential are required to implement due diligence procedures to identify account holders (i.e. policyholders in case where the financial institution is an insurance company) and in the case where the account holder is an entity, its “controlling persons”, who are foreign tax residents, and report this information to the Inland Revenue Department (“IRD”) if required. The IRD may transfer this information to the country of tax residence of such account holders. In order to comply with the law, Prudential may require you, the account holder, to:\n",
      "1. complete and provide us with a self-certification form with information regarding your tax residence status, your tax identification number in your country or countries of tax residence, your date of birth, and in the case where the policyholder is an entity (for example, a trust or a company), the classification of the entity that holds the policy and information regarding “controlling persons” of such entities;\n",
      "2. provide us all required information and documentation for complying with Prudential’s due diligence procedures; and\n",
      "3. advise us of any change in circumstances which affect your tax residence status and provide us with a suitably updated self-certification form within 30 days of such change in circumstances.\n",

      "###Self-Certifications for New Accounts\n",
      "According to the due diligence procedures set out in the Amendment Ordinance, self-certifications are required from account holders for all new accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "###Pre-Existing Accounts\n",
      "If a reporting financial institution has doubts about the tax residence of an account holder, it may require a self-certification from the account holder to verify its tax residence.\n",
      "\n",
      "###Professional Advice\n",
      "Prudential cannot provide you with any tax or legal advice. If you have doubts about your tax residence you should seek professional advice. You should seek independent professional advice on the impact that AEOI may have on you or your policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "###Liabilities\n",
      "An account holder who knowingly or recklessly provides a statement that is misleading, false or incorrect in a material particular in making a self-certification to a reporting financial institution is liable on conviction to a fine at level 3 (HKD 10,000).\n",

      "\n",
      "We aim to protect the rights and manage the reasonable expectations of all Shareholder-backed Participating policyholders. Our investment objective is to maximize policyholders’ returns with an acceptable level of risk through a broad mix of investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Investment Strategy\n",
      "\n",
      "The Shareholder-backed Participating Fund invests in various types of assets, such as equity-type securities and fixed-income securities, to diversify investment risks. Equity-type securities aim to provide policyholders with the potential for a higher long-term return.\n",
      "\n",
      "We adopt an actively managed investment strategy, adjusting it in response to changing market conditions. Our experts allocate a smaller proportion of higher-risk assets, such as equities, to insurance plans with a higher guarantee and a larger proportion of higher-risk assets to insurance plans with lower guarantees. This approach aims to match the level of risk to the risk profiles of our products. We may utilize derivatives to manage risks or improve returns and may also engage in securities lending to enhance returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current long-term target asset allocation is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "|Asset Type|Allocation (%)|\n",
      "|---|---|\n",
      "|Fixed-income securities|55%|\n",
      "|Equity-type securities|45%|\n",
      "\n",
      "Our guaranteed liabilities to policyholders are mainly supported by fixed-income securities. We primarily invest in fixed-income securities rated at least investment-grade, with a small portion of high-yield and emerging-market bonds included for yield improvement and diversification. For equity-type securities, most investments are in stocks listed on major international exchanges.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there are any material changes in the investment strategy, we will inform you of the changes and explain the reasons behind them and their implications.\n",

      "# Currency Strategy and Investment Approach\n",
      "\n",
      "# Currency Strategy and Investment Approach\n",
      "\n",
      "Our currency strategy is to broadly match the fixed-income securities to the underlying policy denomination, while we allow more flexibility for equity-type securities for diversification. Subject to market availability and opportunity, we may invest fixed-income securities in a currency other than the underlying policy denomination and currency hedging may be used to reduce the currency risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "We invest globally to achieve diversification benefits and we currently have a higher relative allocation in the US and Asia which will be reviewed regularly.\n",
      "\n",
      "We actively manage and adjust actual exposure in response to changing market conditions and opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given asset values may vary due to changes in the economic environment and investment performance, the actual allocation may vary from the target allocation above. On a regular basis, we review the investment mix to be in line with our investment objectives and risk appetite.

      "\n",
      "How may our credit risk affect your policy?\n",
      "\n",
      "The guaranteed cash value (if applicable) and insurance benefit of your plan are subject to our credit risk. If we become insolvent, you may lose the value of your policy and its coverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "How may currency exchange rate risk affect your benefits?\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign currency exchange rates may fluctuate. As a result, you may incur a substantial loss when you choose to convert your benefits to other currencies. Additionally, the conversion of your benefits to other currencies is subject to exchange restrictions applicable at the time when the benefits are paid. You have the sole responsibility to decide if you want to convert your benefits to other currencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the risks of surrendering your plan or withdrawing money from your plan?\n",
      "\n",
      "The liquidity of an insurance policy is limited. You are strongly advised to reserve adequate liquid assets for emergencies. For any surrender/withdrawal especially at the early stage upon policy inception, you may receive an amount considerably less than the premiums you paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "How may inflation affect the value of your plan?\n",
      "\n",
      "We expect the cost of living to rise in the future because of inflation. That means the insurance you take out today will not have the same buying power in the future, even if the plan offers increasing benefit intended to offset inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "What happens if you do not pay your premiums?\n",
      "\n",
      "You should only apply for this product if you intend to pay all of its premiums. If you miss any of your premium payments, we will automatically settle your outstanding premiums or premiums and levy(ies) by an automatic premium loan, with interest charged at a rate as determined by us. In the case the loan amount (plus accrued interest) exceeds the amount we allow for loan under the policy, we may terminate your policy and you may receive an amount considerably less than the premiums you paid, as well as losing the policy’s coverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why may we adjust your premiums?\n",
      "\n",
      "We have the right to review and adjust the plan’s premium rates for particular risk classes on each policy anniversary, but not for any individual customer. We may adjust premium rates because of several factors, such as our claims, investment, and persistency experience.\n",

Provided that no claim has been made, the customer may cancel the policy by giving written notice to us within 21 calendar days immediately following either the day of delivery of (1) the policy or (2) the notice (informing the availability of the policy and expiry date of the cooling-off period) to the customer or his/her nominated representative, whichever is earlier. Such notice must be signed by the customer and received directly by Prudential Hong Kong Limited at 8/F, Prudential Tower, The Gateway, Harbour City, 21 Canton Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong within the cooling-off period. The premium and levy will be refunded in the currency of premium and levy payment at the time of application for this policy. If the currency of premium and levy payment is not the same as the plan currency, the refundable premium and levy amount in plan currency under this policy will be converted to the currency of premium and levy payment at the prevailing currency exchange rate as determined by us in our absolute discretion from time to time upon payment. After the cooling-off period expires, if a customer cancels the policy before the end of benefit term, the actual cash value (if applicable) may be substantially less than the total amount of premiums paid.\n",

      "\n",
      "Over 100 countries and jurisdictions around the world have committed to adopt new rules for automatic exchange of financial account information (“AEOI”). Under the new rules, financial institutions are required to identify account holders who are foreign tax residents and report certain information regarding their investment income and account balance to the local tax authority where the financial institution operates. When countries or jurisdictions start exchanging information on an automatic basis, the relevant local tax authority where the financial account is maintained will then provide this information to the tax authority of the account holder’s country of tax residence. This information exchange will be conducted on a regular, annual basis.\n",

Therefore, the above requirements will be applicable to financial institutions in Hong Kong including Prudential. Under these rules, certain policyholders of Prudential are considered as “account holders”. Financial institutions in Hong Kong including Prudential are required to implement due diligence procedures to identify account holders (i.e. policyholders in case where the financial institution is an insurance company) and in the case where the account holder is an entity, its “controlling persons”, who are foreign tax residents, and report this information to the Inland Revenue Department (“IRD”) if required. The IRD may transfer this information to the country of tax residence of such account holders.\n",

      "2. Provide us all required information and documentation for complying with Prudential’s due diligence procedures; and\n",

      "# Investment Philosophy\n",
      "\n",
      "We aim to protect the rights and manage the reasonable expectations of all Shareholder-backed Participating policyholders. Our investment objective is to maximize policyholders’ returns with an acceptable level of risk through a broad mix of investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Investment Strategy\n",
      "\n",
      "The Shareholder-backed Participating Fund invests in various types of assets, such as equity-type securities and fixed-income securities to diversify investment risks. The equity-type securities aim to provide policyholders with the potential for a higher long-term return.\n",
      "\n",
      "We adopt an actively managed investment strategy, adjusting it in response to changing market conditions. Our experts allocate assets based on the risk profiles of our products, aiming to match the level of risk accordingly. Derivatives and securities-lending may be utilized to manage risks and enhance returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Investment Mix\n",
      "\n",
      "The current long-term target asset allocation is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "|Asset Type|Allocation (%)|\n",
      "|---|---|\n",
      "|Fixed-income securities|70%|\n",
      "|Equity-type securities|30%|\n",
      "\n",
      "Our guaranteed liabilities to policyholders are mainly supported by fixed-income securities. We invest primarily in fixed-income securities rated at least investment-grade, with a small portion of high-yield and emerging-market bonds for yield improvement and diversification.\n",
      "\n",
      "For equity-type securities, investments are mainly in stocks listed on major international exchanges. Our currency strategy matches fixed-income securities to the underlying policy denomination, with more flexibility for equity-type securities. Currency hedging is used to reduce currency risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "We invest globally for diversification benefits, with a higher relative allocation in the US and Asia. Actual exposure is actively managed and adjusted in response to market conditions and opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given potential variations in asset values, the actual allocation may differ from the target allocation. Regular reviews ensure alignment with investment objectives and risk appetite.\n",

      "# Key Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "How may our credit risk affect your policy?\n",
      "\n",
      "The guaranteed cash value (if applicable) and insurance benefit of your plan are subject to our credit risk. If we become insolvent, you may lose the value of your policy and its coverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "How may currency exchange rate risk affect your benefits?\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign currency exchange rates may fluctuate. As a result, you may incur a substantial loss when you choose to convert your benefits to other currencies. Additionally, the conversion of your benefits to other currencies is subject to exchange restrictions applicable at the time when the benefits are paid. You have the sole responsibility to decide if you want to convert your benefits to other currencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the risks of surrendering your plan or withdrawing money from your plan?\n",
      "\n",
      "The liquidity of an insurance policy is limited. You are strongly advised to reserve adequate liquid assets for emergencies. For any surrender/withdrawal, especially at the early stage upon policy inception, you may receive an amount considerably less than the premiums you paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "How may inflation affect the value of your plan?\n",
      "\n",
      "We expect the cost of living to rise in the future because of inflation. That means the insurance you take out today will not have the same buying power in the future, even if the plan offers increasing benefits intended to offset inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "What happens if you do not pay your premiums?\n",
      "\n",
      "You should only apply for this product if you intend to pay all its premiums. If you miss any of your premium payments, we will automatically settle your outstanding premiums or premiums and levy(ies) by an automatic premium loan, with interest charged at a rate determined by us. In the case the loan amount (plus accrued interest) exceeds the amount we allow for loan under the policy, we may terminate your policy and you may receive an amount considerably less than the premiums you paid, as well as losing the policy’s coverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why may we adjust your premiums?\n",
      "\n",
      "We have the right to review and adjust the plan’s premium rates for particular risk classes on each policy anniversary, but not for any individual customer. We may adjust premium rates because of several factors, such as our claims, investment, and persistency experience.\n",

Provided that no claim has been made, the customer may cancel the policy by giving written notice to us within 21 calendar days immediately following either the day of delivery of (1) the policy or (2) the notice (informing the availability of the policy and expiry date of the cooling-off period) to the customer or his/her nominated representative, whichever is earlier. Such notice must be signed by the customer and received directly by Prudential Hong Kong Limited at 8/F, Prudential Tower, The Gateway, Harbour City, 21 Canton Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong within the cooling-off period. The premium and levy will be refunded in the currency of premium and levy payment at the time of application for this policy. If the currency of premium and levy payment is not the same as the plan currency, the refundable premium and levy amount in plan currency under this policy will be converted to the currency of premium and levy payment at the prevailing currency exchange rate as determined by us in our absolute discretion from time to time upon payment. After the cooling-off period expires, if a customer cancels the policy before the end of benefit term, the actual cash value (if applicable) may be substantially less than the total amount of premiums paid.\n",

      "## Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information\n",
      "\n",
      "Over 100 countries and jurisdictions around the world have committed to adopt new rules for automatic exchange of financial account information (“AEOI”). Under the new rules, financial institutions are required to identify account holders who are foreign tax residents and report certain information regarding their investment income and account balance to the local tax authority where the financial institution operates. When countries or jurisdictions start exchanging information on an automatic basis, the relevant local tax authority where the financial account is maintained will then provide this information to the tax authority of the account holder’s country of tax residence. This information exchange will be conducted on a regular, annual basis. Hong Kong has adopted the new rules into its legislation (please see the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 3) Ordinance 2016 (“the Amendment Ordinance”) which came into effect on 30 June 2016). Therefore, the above requirements will be applicable to financial institutions in Hong Kong including Prudential. Under these rules, certain policyholders of Prudential are considered as “account holders”. Financial institutions in Hong Kong including Prudential are required to implement due diligence procedures to identify account holders (i.e. policyholders in case where the financial institution is an insurance company) and in the case where the account holder is an entity, its “controlling persons”, who are foreign tax residents, and report this information to the Inland Revenue Department (“IRD”) if required. The IRD may transfer this information to the country of tax residence of such account holders. In order to comply with the law, Prudential may require you, the account holder, to: (1) complete and provide us with a self-certification form with information regarding your tax residence status, your tax identification number in your country or countries of tax residence, your date of birth, and in the case where the policyholder is an entity (for example, a trust or a company), the classification of the entity that holds the policy and information regarding “controlling persons” of such entities; (2) provide us all required information and documentation for complying with Prudential’s due diligence procedures; and (3) advise us of any change in circumstances which affect your tax residence status and provide us with a suitably updated self-certification form within 30 days of such change in circumstances.\n",

      "According to the due diligence procedures set out in the Amendment Ordinance, self-certifications are required from account holders for all new accounts. As for pre-existing accounts, if a reporting financial institution has doubts about the tax residence of an account holder, it may require a self-certification from the account holder to verify its tax residence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prudential cannot provide you with any tax or legal advice. If you have doubts about your tax residence you should seek professional advice. You should seek independent professional advice on the impact that AEOI may have on you or your policy.\n",

      "##What happens to my cover after I have claimed the Major Disease Benefit?\n",
      "###After the Major Disease Benefit claim, you do not need to pay any more premiums for your plan, and the life assured is still covered by the Extended Major Disease Benefit and the Cancer Treatment Extra Benefit.\n",
      "###You can make 2 further claims for Cancer and also 2 further claims for a combination of Heart Attack or Stroke up to age 86 (ANB) under the Extended Major Disease Benefit.\n",
      "###We keep protecting the life assured with the Cancer Treatment Extra Benefit if their Cancer unfortunately recurs or persists. We cover them from 1 year after the date of diagnosis of each preceding Cancer which we have paid the Major Disease Benefit or Extended Major Disease Benefit, before they reach age 86 (ANB).\n",
      "###Once we have paid the Major Disease Benefit, the Early Stage Major Disease Benefit, Early Stage Critical Illness Premium Waiver Benefit, Intensive Care Benefit, Parental Premium Waiver Benefit, Death Benefit, Surrender Value, Special Bonus and Critical Illness Care Enhancer III are no longer available.\n",
      "\n",
      "##How do I make multiple claims?\n",
      "###Making a claim on Extended Major Disease Benefit\n",
      "####For us to pay the Extended Major Disease Benefit for the life assured under age 86 (ANB), they need to survive for at least 14 days from the date of diagnosis. They should also fulfil the “waiting period” and “making Extended Major Disease Benefit claim(s) for Prostate Cancer” requirements which we have explained in the “More about the plan” section later in the brochure.\n",
      "###Making a claim for Early Stage Major Disease Benefit\n",

In the first 10 years of their policies, they are both entitled to the plan’s Family Extra Benefit.

      "The plan helps you protect your child (as the life assured aged 1 – 18 (ANB) when the plan comes into force), even if you are no longer able to, with a Parental Premium Waiver Benefit – without the need to give us any health information. If you (or your spouse) are aged 19 – 51 (ANB) when your plan comes into force, and unfortunately pass away before the premium term ends, we will waive the future basic premiums of your plan, starting from the next due premium, until the life assured reaches age 26 (ANB) or the premium term ends, whichever is earlier. That means your loved ones’ protection stays in place, even when finances may be tight after the loss of a family breadwinner.\n",

      "\n",
      "##Investment Objective\n",
      "Our aim is to protect the rights and manage the reasonable expectations of all Shareholder-backed Participating policyholders. The investment objective is to maximize policyholders’ returns while maintaining an acceptable level of risk. This is achieved through a diverse mix of investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Investment Strategy\n",
      "The Shareholder-backed Participating Fund invests in various asset types, including equity-type securities and fixed-income securities, to diversify investment risks. Equity-type securities are chosen to provide policyholders with the potential for higher long-term returns. We employ an actively managed investment strategy that is adjusted in response to changing market conditions. Our experts allocate a smaller proportion of higher-risk assets, such as equities, to insurance plans with higher guarantees and a larger proportion to plans with lower guarantees. This approach aims to align the level of risk with the risk profiles of our products. Derivatives may be utilized to manage risks or enhance returns, and securities-lending may be employed to boost returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "###Current Investment Mix\n",
      "The current long-term target asset allocation is as follows:\n",
      "\n",

      "|-----------------------|----------------|\n",

      "| Equity-type securities  | 45%          |\n",
      "\n",
      "Our guaranteed liabilities to policyholders are primarily supported by fixed-income securities. We predominantly invest in fixed-income securities rated at least investment-grade, with a small portion allocated to high-yield and emerging-market bonds for improved yield and diversification. When it comes to equity-type securities, the majority of investments are in stocks listed on major international exchanges.\n",
      "---\n",
      "#Currency Strategy\n",
      "\n",
      "##Investment Approach\n",
      "Our currency strategy is to broadly match the fixed-income securities to the underlying policy denomination, while we allow more flexibility for equity-type securities for diversification. Subject to market availability and opportunity, we may invest fixed-income securities in a currency other than the underlying policy denomination and currency hedging may be used to reduce the currency risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Global Diversification\n",
      "We invest globally to achieve diversification benefits and we currently have a higher relative allocation in the US and Asia which will be reviewed regularly.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Active Management\n",
      "We actively manage and adjust actual exposure in response to changing market conditions and opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Asset Allocation\n",
      "Given asset values may vary due to changes in the economic environment and investment performance, the actual allocation may vary from the target allocation above. On a regular basis, we review the investment mix to be in line with our investment objectives and risk appetite.

      "\n",
      "##How may our credit risk affect your policy?\n",
      "Foreign currency exchange rates may fluctuate. As a result, you may incur a substantial loss when you choose to convert your benefits to other currencies. Additionally, the conversion of your benefits to other currencies is subject to exchange restrictions applicable at the time when the benefits are paid. You have the sole responsibility to decide if you want to convert your benefits to other currencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "##How may currency exchange rate risk affect your benefits?\n",
      "The guaranteed cash value (if applicable) and insurance benefit of your plan are subject to our credit risk. If we become insolvent, you may lose the value of your policy and its coverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "##What are the risks of surrendering your plan or withdrawing money from your plan?\n",
      "The liquidity of an insurance policy is limited. You are strongly advised to reserve adequate liquid assets for emergencies. For any surrender/withdrawal especially at the early stage upon policy inception, you may receive an amount considerably less than the premiums you paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "##How may inflation affect the value of your plan?\n",
      "We expect the cost of living to rise in the future because of inflation. That means the insurance you take out today will not have the same buying power in the future, even if the plan offers increasing benefit intended to offset inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "##What happens if you do not pay your premiums?\n",
      "You should only apply for this product if you intend to pay all of its premiums. If you miss any of your premium payments, we will automatically settle your outstanding premiums or premiums and levy(ies) by an automatic premium loan, with interest charged at a rate as determined by us. In the case the loan amount (plus accrued interest) exceeds the amount we allow for loan under the policy, we may terminate your policy and you may receive an amount considerably less than the premiums you paid, as well as losing the policy’s coverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Why may we adjust your premiums?\n",
      "We have the right to review and adjust the plan’s premium rates for particular risk classes on each policy anniversary, but not for any individual customer. We may adjust premium rates because of several factors, such as our claims, investment, and persistency experience.\n",

      "#Important information\n",
      "\n",
      "##Suicide clause\n",
      "###Cancellation right\n",
      "- A customer who has bought the life insurance plans has a right to cancel the policy within the cooling-off period and obtain a refund of any premium(s) and levy(ies) paid less any withdrawals. Provided that no claim has been made, the customer may cancel the policy by giving written notice to us within 21 calendar days immediately following either the day of delivery of (1) the policy or (2) the notice (informing the availability of the policy and expiry date of the cooling-off period) to the customer or his/her nominated representative, whichever is earlier. Such notice must be signed by the customer and received directly by Prudential Hong Kong Limited at 8/F, Prudential Tower, The Gateway, Harbour City, 21 Canton Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong within the cooling-off period. The premium and levy will be refunded in the currency of premium and levy payment at the time of application for this policy. If the currency of premium and levy payment is not the same as the plan currency, the refundable premium and levy amount in plan currency under this policy will be converted to the currency of premium and levy payment at the prevailing currency exchange rate as determined by us in our absolute discretion from time to time upon payment. After the cooling-off period expires, if a customer cancels the policy before the end of benefit term, the actual cash value (if applicable) may be substantially less than the total amount of premiums paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information\n",
      "- Over 100 countries and jurisdictions around the world have committed to adopt new rules for automatic exchange of financial account information (“AEOI”). Under the new rules, financial institutions are required to identify account holders who are foreign tax residents and report certain information regarding their investment income and account balance to the local tax authority where the financial institution operates. When countries or jurisdictions start exchanging information on an automatic basis, the relevant local tax authority where the financial account is maintained will then provide this information to the tax authority of the account holder’s country of tax residence. This information exchange will be conducted on a regular, annual basis. Hong Kong has adopted the new rules into its legislation (please see the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 3) Ordinance 2016 (“the Amendment Ordinance”) which came into effect on 30 June 2016). Therefore, the above requirements will be applicable to financial institutions in Hong Kong including Prudential. Under these rules, certain policyholders of Prudential are considered as “account holders”. Financial institutions in Hong Kong including Prudential are required to implement due diligence procedures to identify account holders (i.e. policyholders in case where the financial institution is an insurance company) and in the case where the account holder is an entity, its “controlling persons”, who are foreign tax residents, and report this information to the Inland Revenue Department (“IRD”) if required.
